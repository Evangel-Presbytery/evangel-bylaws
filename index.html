<h1>Bylaws</h1>
<section id="name" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="name">1. Name</h2>
<p>The incorporated name of this body shall be “Evangel Presbytery, Inc.”</p>
</section>
<section id="object" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="object">2. Object</h2>
<p>The object of this body is to fulfill the requirements for the Presbytery as set forth in the <em>Book of Church Order of Evangel Presbytery</em> (<a href="https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/form-of-government.html#the-presbytery">15.8</a>; hereafter, “ <em>Book of Church Order” or “BCO”</em> ). The doctrinal and governmental standards of this Presbytery shall be those stated in the <em>Book of Church Order</em> (<a href="https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/preface.html">Preface, C</a>). These Bylaws are not to conflict with the <em>Book of Church Order</em> , and in any case of conflict, the standards of the <em>Book of Church Order</em> shall take precedence.</p>
</section>
<section id="members" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="members">3. Members</h2>
<p>Members of this Presbytery shall be in two classes: Ordained Ministers of the Word (Pastors) and the particular churches. Standards for examination for membership of both Ministers and churches shall be as set forth in the <em>Book of Church Order</em>. Representation of elders from particular churches shall be in accordance with the provisions of the <em>Book of Church Order</em>.</p>
</section>
<section id="officers" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="officers">4. Officers</h2>
<p>All officers shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast at the Stated Meeting scheduled for that purpose. The various offices of the Presbytery, and their functions, are as follows:</p>
<ol type="A">
<li><p>Moderator</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Eligibility: The Moderator shall be a Pastor who is a member in good standing of the Presbytery, or an Elder in good standing of a member church of the Presbytery. The Elder does not have to be currently active on the Session of his church if that church follows a rotation system for its Session. A moderator may not succeed himself, nor serve a second term in office within one year of previously having served.</li>
<li>Tenure: The Moderator of the Presbytery shall be chosen at each stated meeting or for a period of time up to one (1) year (<a href="https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/form-of-government.html#church-courtsin-general"><em>BCO</em> 12.3</a>). He will continue to serve in office until a successor is elected at a Stated Meeting. He will preside over called or other special meetings, and otherwise function as Moderator during his tenure. As a general rule, the position of Moderator should alternate between Pastors and Elders.</li>
<li>Moderator-in-Nomination: At each Stated Meeting of Presbytery or at the Stated Meeting preceding the final meeting of the current Moderator’s tenure, a Moderator-in-Nomination will be elected, with the understanding that his name will automatically be placed in nomination for the office of moderator at the next Stated Meeting. This policy is established to enable men to prepare themselves to function in this office to the best of their ability, and to be aware of current issues before the court. However, election as Moderator-in-Nomination does not require the Presbytery to elect this nominee at its next Stated Meeting, at which time a normal process of nominations and elections will be followed.</li>
<li>Duties:
<ol type="a">
<li>The Moderator of Presbytery will function as chairman of all meetings of Presbytery, following approved parliamentary procedure.</li>
<li>If no worship service has been held prior to the meeting of Presbytery, the retiring Moderator shall ordinarily bring a message from God’s Word in an appropriate time of devotion.</li>
<li>Between meetings, the Moderator has the responsibility to speak for the Presbytery in matters in which the Presbytery itself has made its commitments clear, and he should be consulted in all matters affecting the Presbytery as a whole.</li>
<li>He may appoint a Parliamentarian to serve for each Stated Meeting.</li>
<li>In any emergency the Moderator may, by adequate and appropriate means, including circular letter, telephone notification, or email, change the time or place (or both) of meetings to which the court stands adjourned, giving reasonable notice of such change.</li>
<li>The Moderator shall appoint the members of Temporary Committees and Ad Interim Committees. The Moderator may appoint the chairmen of these committees or he may advise their members to elect chairmen from among themselves. The presbytery is to be informed once committee chairmen have been established.</li>
<li>The Moderator, by the authority vested in him, is an ex-officio member of the Administrative Committee.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Vice Moderator</p>
<p>The Vice Moderator shall be the immediate past Moderator and shall serve at the request of the Moderator, or when the Moderator is unable to serve. In the event the Vice Moderator is not able to serve, the Stated Clerk shall preside, and, as its first order of business, Presbytery shall nominate and elect a Moderator Pro Tem to moderate during the Moderator’s and Vice Moderator’s absence. The Vice Moderator, by the authority vested in him, is an ex-officio member of the Administrative Committee.</p></li>
<li><p>Stated Clerk</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Eligibility: The Stated Clerk shall be a Pastor who is a member in good standing of the Presbytery, or an Elder in good standing of a member church of the Presbytery. The Elder does not have to be currently active on the Session of his church if that church follows a rotation system for its Session.</li>
<li>Tenure: The Stated Clerk will be elected at the Spring/Summer Stated Meeting and shall serve for a period of three (3) years. He may succeed himself as often as the Presbytery so desires. It is deemed advisable that this be done whenever possible.</li>
<li>Duties: The Stated Clerk shall perform the duties assigned by the <em>Book of Church Order</em> (<a href="https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/form-of-government.html#church-courtsin-general">12.4</a>). He shall perform other duties as assigned by the Presbytery. The Stated Clerk may receive an annual stipend to be fixed by the Presbytery. In the administration of his duties, the Stated Clerk shall be under the supervision of the Administrative Committee. The Presbytery shall provide or reimburse the Stated Clerk for all costs required by the duties of his office upon presentation of proper cost statements subject to the limitations of the current approved budget. His duties will include, but not be limited to the following,
<ol type="a">
<li>keep proper minutes of all Presbytery and Committee/Commission meetings, giving certified extracts therefrom when required;</li>
<li>assemble the items of business to come before the Presbytery and refer each item to the proper committee (if the clerk has questions regarding reference, he is to consult with the Administrative Committee before making reference);</li>
<li>send to each member and church (including men under care) notice of all meetings; note the attendance at each meeting and make recommendations concerning absences at Stated Meetings;</li>

<li>maintain a supply of necessary forms for use by churches;</li>

<li>advise the Moderator in every possible way, by keeping him informed of matters requiring his attention, giving notice for him of Called Meetings of Presbytery or changes in time and place of Meetings, making the facilities of the office available to him for correspondence or other matters, and rendering any service requested by the Moderator in connection with the operation of Presbytery.</li>
<li>He shall be an ex-officio member of Presbytery’s Administrative Committee.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Assistant Clerks and Office Staff. When necessary to the performance of his duties, and upon recommendation by the Administrative Committee, the Presbytery may authorize the hiring of clerical help and services (such as printing and duplication) to assist the Stated Clerk in carrying out the duties of his office.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Recording Clerk</p>
<p>The Recording Clerk shall be appointed by the Stated Clerk for a term of one (1) year, informing the Presbytery of this appointment during his clerk’s report at the beginning of the first presbytery meeting following that appointment. The Recording Clerk shall normally be a member of Presbytery or a ruling elder of a member church. The appointment shall normally be announced at the Spring/Summer Stated Meeting, with term of office to begin at the Fall Stated Meeting. The Recording Clerk may receive a stipend to be fixed by the Presbytery. He shall be given two (2) copies of all committee reports as presented to Presbytery for inclusion in the Minutes and a written copy of all motions adopted by Presbytery. As soon as practicable, he shall convey the Minutes in type-written form (or any other form acceptable to the Stated Clerk), properly recorded, to the Stated Clerk for editing and publishing. The Minutes shall be reviewed by the Stated Clerk and Moderator prior to circulation to the presbytery for their review and approval.</p></li>

The Presbytery shall provide or reimburse the Treasurer for all costs required by the duties of his office upon presentation of proper cost statements subject to the limitations of the current approved budget. He shall be bonded in an amount to be determined by the Presbytery, or the books of the presbytery shall be audited, annually. His duties shall include but not be limited to:

<li>in general, perform all of the duties incident to the office of Treasurer.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Trustees</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Eligibility: The Board of Trustees of the Presbytery shall consist of the Stated Clerk, plus two other members of Presbytery elected at large. Eligibility for this office shall be the same as for all other offices.</li>
<li>Tenure: Trustees will serve for the period of their Committee Chairmanship, or three (3) years, whichever is shorter. Trustees may be re-elected to office upon two-thirds (2/3)of the votes cast. Election will be held at Spring/Summer Stated Meeting.</li>

<p>As directed by presbytery’s Stated Clerk, each church Session is to deliver a copy of its court records to the Sessional Record Committee for their examination. . All efforts should be made to see that no more than one-third of the total roll of churches in Presbytery be examined at each Stated Meeting.</p>
<p>Each church Session whose records are scheduled for examination shall email a copy of their unexamined records to the Chairman of the Sessional Records Committee no later than six (6) weeks prior to the upcoming Stated Meeting.</p>
<p>The Sessional Records Committee shall examine the records in accordance with <a href="https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/the-rules-of-discipline.html#general-review-and-control"><em>BCO</em> Chapter 43</a> and shall classify exceptions as notations, exceptions of form, or exceptions of substance. Notations are typographical errors, misspellings, improper punctuation, and other minor variations in form and clarity. Exceptions of Form are violations of Evangel Presbytery’s Guidelines for Keeping Session Minutes (appendix) or violations of rules of order. Exceptions of Substance are apparent violations of the Scripture or serious irregularities from the Constitution of Evangel Presbytery, actions out of accord with the deliverances of the Presbytery, and matters of impropriety and important delinquencies.

<section id="electronic-meetings" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="electronic-meetings">10. Electronic Meetings</h2>
<p>Sometimes matters arise needing action prior to the next stated meeting of presbytery. When a special called meeting of presbytery or one of its committees, subcommittees, or commissions is impractical, special called meetings are allowed via any means of communication which allows all participants simultaneously to hear and communicate with each other (for example, tele-conference or video-conference). If a meeting is conducted by such means, the presiding officer shall inform all participants at the commencement of the meeting that a meeting is taking place at which official business may be transacted. Any participant in a meeting by such means shall be deemed present in person at such meeting. The moderator of the meeting may establish reasonable rules to conduct the meeting. Committees and subcommittees may hold their regular stated meetings in this manner, also.</p>
<p>Written consent by the members of the Presbytery, a committee, or a subcommittee can be undertaken via email, or other electronic record communication, if the written consent setting forth the action to be taken is circulated to all members via email, or other electronic record communication, and at least eighty percent (80%) of the members indicate their approval by return email or other approved electronic record communication. The Presbytery shall confirm with each member the electronic address or addresses, such as an email address or text message number, for that member to be used for purposes of sending and receiving email, text or other electronic record communications, and for the purpose of notices to and from the Presbytery, and shall maintain such information as part of the Presbytery’s current records, which may be maintained electronically. The Presbytery shall provide its address, and the electronic addresses of the other members, to be used for purposes of taking such action. The Presbytery may provide for any particular requirements, method or means for taking action electronically and for notices to and from the Presbytery and its members, in which case the action to be taken shall be taken in accordance with such requirements, method, or means.</p>

As with all important digital documents, great care should be taken to ensure that Session minute archives have both local and remote backups. Sessions may keep a physical hard copy of their minutes in addition to their digital copy. If they choose to do so, however, they must ensure that the physical archives do not conflict with the digital ones. The annual budget and annual statistical report should be submitted to the Sessional Records as separate PDF files.</p></li>
