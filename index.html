</h2>
<p>All officers shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast at the Stated Meeting scheduled for that purpose. The various offices of the Presbytery, and their functions, are as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: upper-alpha">
<li>
<p>Moderator</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Eligibility: The Moderator shall be a Pastor who is a member in good standing of the Presbytery, or an Elder in good standing of a member church of the Presbytery. The Elder does not have to be currently active on the Session of his church if that church follows a rotation system for its Session. A moderator may not succeed himself, nor serve a second term in office within one year of previously having served.</li>
<li>Tenure: The Moderator of the Presbytery shall be chosen at each stated meeting or for a period of time up to one (1) year (<a href="https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/form-of-government.html#church-courtsin-general"><em>BCO</em> 12.3</a>). He will continue to serve in office until a successor is elected at a Stated Meeting. He will preside over called or other special meetings, and otherwise function as Moderator during his tenure. As a general rule, the position of Moderator should alternate between Pastors and Elders.</li>
<li>Moderator-in-Nomination: At each Stated Meeting of Presbytery or at the Stated Meeting preceding the final meeting of the current Moderator’s tenure, a Moderator-in-Nomination will be elected, with the understanding that his name will automatically be placed in nomination for the office of moderator at the next Stated Meeting. This policy is established to enable men to prepare themselves to function in this office to the best of their ability, and to be aware of current issues before the court. However, election as Moderator-in-Nomination does not require the Presbytery to elect this nominee at its next Stated Meeting, at which time a normal process of nominations and elections will be followed.</li>
<li>Duties:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The Moderator of Presbytery will function as chairman of all meetings of Presbytery, following approved parliamentary procedure.</li>
<li>If no worship service has been held prior to the meeting of Presbytery, the retiring Moderator shall ordinarily bring a message from God’s Word in an appropriate time of devotion.</li>
<li>Between meetings, the Moderator has the responsibility to speak for the Presbytery in matters in which the Presbytery itself has made its commitments clear, and he should be consulted in all matters affecting the Presbytery as a whole.</li>
<li>He may appoint a Parliamentarian to serve for each Stated Meeting.</li>
<li>In any emergency the Moderator may, by adequate and appropriate means, including circular letter, telephone notification, or email, change the time or place (or both) of meetings to which the court stands adjourned, giving reasonable notice of such change.</li>
<li>The Moderator shall nominate the members of Temporary Committees and Ad Interim Committees. Nominees will be approved by the Presbytery. The Moderator shall appoint the chairmen of Temporary Committees and Ad Interim Committees and inform the Presbytery of his appointment. He may also advise the members of these committees to elect chairmen from among themselves.</li>
<li>The Moderator, by the authority vested in him, is an ex-officio member of the Administrative Committee.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vice Moderator</p>
<p>The Vice Moderator shall be the immediate past Moderator and shall serve at the request of the Moderator, or when the Moderator is unable to serve. In the event the Vice Moderator is not able to serve, the Stated Clerk shall preside, and, as its first order of business, Presbytery shall nominate and elect a Moderator Pro Tem to moderate during the Moderator’s and Vice Moderator’s absence. The Vice Moderator, by the authority vested in him, is an ex-officio member of the Administrative Committee.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>Sessional Records Committee</p>
<p>The Sessional Records Committee shall review the minutes of church Sessions for conformity to the Constitution of Evangel Presbytery.</p>
<p>As directed by presbytery’s Stated Clerk, each church Session is to deliver a copy of its court records to the Sessional Record Committee for their examination. . All efforts should be made to see that no more than one-third of the total roll of churches in Presbytery be examined at each Stated Meeting.</p>
<p>Each church Session whose records are scheduled for examination shall mail (or email) a copy of their unexamined records to the Chairman of the Sessional Records Committee no later than four (4) weeks prior to the upcoming Stated Meeting.</p>
<p>The Sessional Records Committee shall examine the records in accordance with <em>BCO</em> Chapter 43 and shall classify exceptions as notations, exceptions of form, or exceptions of substance. Notations are typographical errors, misspellings, improper punctuation, and other minor variations in form and clarity. Exceptions of Form are violations of Evangel Presbytery’s Guidelines for Keeping Session Minutes (appendix) or violations of rules of order. Exceptions of Substance are apparent violations of the Scripture or serious irregularities from the Constitution of Evangel Presbytery, actions out of accord with the deliverances of the Presbytery, and matters of impropriety and important delinquencies. Exceptions of Substance should be limited to serious irregularities, gross errors, corrupt practices and heretical opinions.</p>
<p>Notations and exceptions of form shall normally be sent to the Clerk of Session by the Committee without being read before Presbytery or recorded in its minutes. Exceptions of substance shall be reported to Presbytery as recommendations to be voted upon. The Sessional Records shall be approved without exception; or with exception of form and/or substance.</p>
<p>Sessions shall advise the Presbytery by the following Stated Meeting through the Sessional Records Committee that they have disposed of the exception of substance in one of the following manners: the Session agrees with the exception of substance, corrects its record or action if possible, and promises to try to be more careful in the future; or, the Session respectfully disagrees with the exception of substance, states its grounds and refers the exception back to the Presbytery for action. The Sessional Records Committee will bring a recommendation to Presbytery regarding whether or not the disposition of the matter should be considered satisfactory.</p>
<p>The Sessional Records Committee shall report to Presbytery regarding any Sessional Records that have not been submitted for review in the past year.</p>
<p>The Sessional Records Committee shall provide help for any Clerk of Session seeking guidance in preparing Sessional Records for the yearly Presbytery review.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nominating Committee</p>
<p>The Nominating Committee shall be composed of six (6) members with parity of Ministers and Elders. The Moderator shall be an <em>ex officio</em> member of the Nominating Committee. Members shall be elected by Presbytery at the Spring/Summer Stated Meeting of Presbytery upon nomination from the floor, with terms of office to begin immediately upon election. One Minister and two Elders shall be elected on odd numbered years, and two Ministers and one Elder shall be elected on even numbered years. The quorum shall be at least one half of the elected members. The Committee shall report to Presbytery at the Spring/Summer Stated Meeting by submitting nominations for all Presbytery committees and other vacancies and shall report at other meetings as vacancies occur. The Committee shall submit its nominations to the Stated Clerk two (2) weeks prior to the Spring/Summer Stated Meeting of Presbytery.</p>

<li>
<p>Written Reports</p>
<p>All committee reports shall be in written form with sufficient copies for all presbyters in attendance at the meeting of Presbytery. All committees shall meet and prepare the reports prior to the time of presentation to Presbytery. These reports shall be in the hands of the Stated Clerk and the Administrative Committee at least two (2) weeks prior to the meeting of Presbytery. Prayer for the work of the committees will be included in the opening prayer time. Each committee report, therefore, need not be opened with prayer. Nothing contained herein, however, would prohibit prayer for a specific item or need. Each retiring chairman of a committee shall transmit all files, records and reports pertaining to the committee to the incoming committee chairman. In the event of the disestablishment of a committee, all such records shall be placed in the hands of the Stated Clerk.</p>

<p>All committees shall hold duly constituted meetings at least once a year and report at least annually to Presbytery. If any committee believes that its activities are not contributing to the work of the Presbytery, it shall recommend its dissolution to Presbytery. If no meeting is held by a committee during the year, the Administrative Committee shall consider what shall be done about the designated tasks assigned to that committee, and report to the next meeting of Presbytery. Committees ought not to schedule meetings concurrent with main presbytery meetings. The quorum for any committee meeting shall be two Ministers and two Elders unless otherwise stated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subcommittees</p>
<p>Committees, when it is expedient, shall be empowered to create such subcommittees as are deemed necessary by them. Such subcommittees shall report to Presbytery through the parent committee.

</h2>
<p>Sometimes matters arise needing action prior to the next stated meeting of presbytery. When a special called meeting of presbytery or one of its committees, subcommittees, or commissions is impractical, special called meetings are allowed via any means of communication which allows all participants simultaneously to hear and communicate with each other (for example, tele-conference or video-conference). If a meeting is conducted by such means, the presiding officer shall inform all participants at the commencement of the meeting that a meeting is taking place at which official business may be transacted. Any participant in a meeting by such means shall be deemed present in person at such meeting. The moderator of the meeting may establish reasonable rules to conduct the meeting. Committees and subcommittees may hold their regular stated meetings in this manner, also.</p>
<p>Written consent by the members of the Presbytery, a committee, or a subcommittee can be undertaken via email, or other electronic record communication, if the written consent setting forth the action to be taken is circulated to all members via email, or other electronic record communication, and at least eighty percent (80%) of the members indicate their approval by return email or other approved electronic record communication. The Presbytery shall confirm with each member the electronic address or addresses, such as an email address or text message number, for that member to be used for purposes of sending and receiving email, text or other electronic record communications, and for the purpose of notices to and from the Presbytery, and shall maintain such information as part of the Presbytery’s current records, which may be maintained electronically. The Presbytery shall provide its address, and the electronic addresses of the other members, to be used for purposes of taking such action. The Presbytery may provide for any particular requirements, method or means for taking action electronically and for notices to and from the Presbytery and its members, in which case the action to be taken shall be taken in accordance with such requirements, method, or means.</p>

<p>All parliamentary procedures must be in accordance with the <em>Book of Church Order</em> and the most recent edition of <em>Robert’s Rules of Order</em> .

<p>These Bylaws may be temporarily suspended, amended, or revised at any Stated Meeting of Presbytery by a two-thirds (2/3) majority of the votes cast, unless such suspension, amendment, or revision would violate any part of the <em>Book of Church Order</em> . Any permanent amendment, revision, or repeal of the Bylaws must be proposed in writing at a Stated Meeting, approved by a two-thirds (2/3) majority of the votes cast of that Stated Meeting, and ratified by a two-thirds (2/3) majority of the votes cast at the following Stated Meeting of Presbytery.</p>

</h2>
<p>A. Session Minutes must include the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A statement of the date, time, place, and purpose of the meeting (Stated, Called, adjourned stated, etc.)</li>
<li>If the meeting is a called meeting the minutes must include the portion of the call that indicates the purpose of the meeting.</li>
<li>That the meeting was opened and closed with prayer.</li>
<li>The names of all in attendance or absent from the meeting.</li>
<li>That a quorum was present for the meeting.</li>
<li>Communications received, and any action taken because of the communications.</li>
<li>Approval of minutes from previous meetings.</li>
<li>A statement that indicates the review and approval of the Diaconate minutes.</li>
<li>A statement that indicates the receiving of the Treasurer’s report as information.</li>
<li>The actions of the Session including all the motions adopted and business transacted.</li>
</ol>
<p>B. When applicable, the minutes shall include the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A record of all covenant baptisms, baptisms upon profession of faith, and dates of the celebration of the Lord’s Supper.</li>
<li>Election of commissioners to presbytery.</li>
<li>A record of the call and purpose for each congregational or corporation meeting.</li>
<li>A motion calling for the nomination and election of church officers.</li>
<li>A record of the officers nominated, trained and examined by the Session.</li>
<li>The December or the following January minutes must include a statement that records the pastor’s annual housing allowance approved by the Session.</li>
<li>The <em>BCO</em> requires Sessions to “…keep a fair record of baptisms, of those admitted to the Lord’s table, of non-communing members, and of the births, marriages, deaths, and dismissions of church members and of any baptisms and marriage ceremonies presided over by the pastors of the church outside its bounds” ( <em>BCO</em> 14.8).</li>
<li>A copy of the approved operating budget and the yearly statistical report should be attached to December’s minutes.</li>
</ol>
<p>All minutes should be typed. They should be simple in word and in formatting. Email should be used when circulating minutes among members of the Session. The minutes should be included in the body of the email and not as an attachment. Once minutes have been officially adopted by the Session, they should be archived digitally using the PDF file format. To archive newly approved minutes, they should be added to the existing PDF archive. The pages should be consecutively numbered, leaving no blank pages between meetings and no records left out. As with all important digital documents, great care should be taken to ensure that Session minute archives have both local and remote backups. Sessions may keep a physical hard copy of their minutes in addition to their digital copy. If they choose to do so, however, they must ensure that the physical archives do not conflict with the digital ones.</p>
<p>C. After the Meeting:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Complete any necessary correspondence as required by actions taken by the Session.</li>
<li>Send transfer of the communicant’s membership certificates to other churches.</li>
<li>Update the church membership records as required by action of the Session (Additions, removals, etc.).</li>
