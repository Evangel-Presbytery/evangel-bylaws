The object of this body is to fulfill the requirements for the Presbytery as set forth in the \emph{Book of Church Order of Evangel Presbytery} (\href{https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/form-of-government.html\#the-presbytery}{15.8}; hereafter, `` \emph{Book of Church Order'' or ``BCO''} ). The doctrinal and governmental standards of this Presbytery shall be those stated in the \emph{Book of Church Order} (\href{https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/preface.html}{Preface, C}). These Bylaws are not to conflict with the \emph{Book of Church Order} , and in any case of conflict, the standards of the \emph{Book of Church Order} shall take precedence.

\hypertarget{section-3-members}{%
\section*{Section 3: Members}\label{section-3-members}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Section 3: Members}

Members of this Presbytery shall be in two classes: Ordained Ministers of the Word (Pastors) and the particular churches. Standards for examination for membership of both Ministers and churches shall be as set forth in the \emph{Book of Church Order}. Representation of elders from particular churches shall be in accordance with the provisions of the \emph{Book of Church Order}.

\hypertarget{section-4-officers}{%
\section*{Section 4: Officers}\label{section-4-officers}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Section 4: Officers}

All officers shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast at the Stated Meeting scheduled for that purpose. The various offices of the Presbytery, and their functions, are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\Alph{enumi}.}
\item
  Moderator

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\arabic{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Eligibility: The Moderator shall be a Pastor who is a member in good standing of the Presbytery, or an Elder in good standing of a member church of the Presbytery. The Elder does not have to be currently active on the Session of his church if that church follows a rotation system for its Session. A moderator may not succeed himself, nor serve a second term in office within one year of previously having served.
  \item
    Tenure: The Moderator of the Presbytery shall be chosen at each stated meeting or for a period of time up to one (1) year (\href{https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/form-of-government.html\#church-courtsin-general}{\emph{BCO} 12.3}). He will continue to serve in office until a successor is elected at a Stated Meeting. He will preside over called or other special meetings, and otherwise function as Moderator during his tenure. As a general rule, the position of Moderator should alternate between Pastors and Elders.
  \item
    Moderator-in-Nomination: At each Stated Meeting of Presbytery or at the Stated Meeting preceding the final meeting of the current Moderator's tenure, a Moderator-in-Nomination will be elected, with the understanding that his name will automatically be placed in nomination for the office of moderator at the next Stated Meeting. This policy is established to enable men to prepare themselves to function in this office to the best of their ability, and to be aware of current issues before the court. However, election as Moderator-in-Nomination does not require the Presbytery to elect this nominee at its next Stated Meeting, at which time a normal process of nominations and elections will be followed.
  \item
    Duties:

    \begin{enumerate}
    \def\labelenumiii{\alph{enumiii}.}
    \tightlist
    \item
      The Moderator of Presbytery will function as chairman of all meetings of Presbytery, following approved parliamentary procedure.
    \item
      If no worship service has been held prior to the meeting of Presbytery, the retiring Moderator shall ordinarily bring a message from God's Word in an appropriate time of devotion.
    \item
      Between meetings, the Moderator has the responsibility to speak for the Presbytery in matters in which the Presbytery itself has made its commitments clear, and he should be consulted in all matters affecting the Presbytery as a whole.
    \item
      He may appoint a Parliamentarian to serve for each Stated Meeting.
    \item
      In any emergency the Moderator may, by adequate and appropriate means, including circular letter, telephone notification, or email, change the time or place (or both) of meetings to which the court stands adjourned, giving reasonable notice of such change.
    \item
      The Moderator shall nominate the members of Temporary Committees and Ad Interim Committees. Nominees will be approved by the Presbytery. The Moderator shall appoint the chairmen of Temporary Committees and Ad Interim Committees and inform the Presbytery of his appointment. He may also advise the members of these committees to elect chairmen from among themselves.
    \item
      The Moderator, by the authority vested in him, is an ex-officio member of the Administrative Committee.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Vice Moderator

  The Vice Moderator shall be the immediate past Moderator and shall serve at the request of the Moderator, or when the Moderator is unable to serve. In the event the Vice Moderator is not able to serve, the Stated Clerk shall preside, and, as its first order of business, Presbytery shall nominate and elect a Moderator Pro Tem to moderate during the Moderator's and Vice Moderator's absence. The Vice Moderator, by the authority vested in him, is an ex-officio member of the Administrative Committee.
\item

In the administration of his duties, the Stated Clerk shall be under the supervision of the Administrative Committee. The Presbytery shall provide or reimburse the Stated Clerk for all costs required by the duties of his office upon presentation of proper cost statements subject to the limitations of the current approved budget.

    \end{enumerate}
  \item

Membership on Subcommittees does not need the approval of the Presbytery as a whole, but will be left to the nomination of the Chairman of the appropriate Subcommittee, with approval of the entire Committee. Membership on Subcommittees may vary at any time according to current needs, with the only restriction being that the same man may not serve more than three (3) continuous years on any given Subcommittee, without approval of two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast at the time nominated to so continue.

A written report outlining the proposed amendment and including said concurrence or non-concurrence of the Administrative Committee shall be submitted by the proposing committee to the Stated Clerk of the Presbytery at least fourteen (14) days before the time fixed for such Stated Meeting in order that the written report and recommendation may be included in the docket for action by the Presbytery.

    Presbytery grants the Administrative Committee the power of a commission to find a complaint in order and to hear the complaint in accordance with \href{https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/the-rules-of-discipline.html\#complaints}{\emph{BCO} 46.8} provided both the party complaining and the party complained against are agreeable to this.
  \item
    Committee on Church Planting and Domestic Missions

    This Committee shall handle all matters involving church planting and growth within the bounds of the Presbytery, both for particular churches, newly planted churches, and separate missions dealing with residents of the area. Specifically, the Committee shall be responsible for the following:

    \item
      coordinating joint efforts with specific churches seeking to plant churches;

    \item
      Subcommittee on Credentials
    \end{enumerate}

    Ordained ministers coming from outside the Presbytery: They ordinarily may not move on to the field without the permission of Presbytery. The Candidates \& Credentials Committee has the power of a commission to grant exceptions to this rule but only after having examined a man on his views in committee and only by a majority of the votes cast in a properly called committee meeting with a quorum present. Any who move onto the field under this provision must understand that their examination must still be sustained by Presbytery and their call must still be approved by Presbytery.

    Candidates licensed to preach in Evangel Presbytery: The Committee may act as a commission to grant permission to a current licentiate in Evangel Presbytery to move on to the field and to function as a student supply or stated supply until the next Stated Meeting of Presbytery. The Committee may do this only by a majority of the votes cast in a properly called committee meeting with a quorum present.

    Sessional Records Committee

    The Sessional Records Committee shall review the minutes of church Sessions for conformity to the Constitution of Evangel Presbytery.

    As directed by presbytery's Stated Clerk, each church Session is to deliver a copy of its court records to the Sessional Record Committee for their examination. . All efforts should be made to see that no more than one-third of the total roll of churches in Presbytery be examined at each Stated Meeting.

    Each church Session whose records are scheduled for examination shall mail (or email) a copy of their unexamined records to the Chairman of the Sessional Records Committee no later than four (4) weeks prior to the upcoming Stated Meeting.

    The Sessional Records Committee shall examine the records in accordance with \href{https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/the-rules-of-discipline.html\#general-review-and-control}{\emph{BCO} Chapter 43} and shall classify exceptions as notations, exceptions of form, or exceptions of substance. Notations are typographical errors, misspellings, improper punctuation, and other minor variations in form and clarity. Exceptions of Form are violations of Evangel Presbytery's Guidelines for Keeping Session Minutes (appendix) or violations of rules of order. Exceptions of Substance are apparent violations of the Scripture or serious irregularities from the Constitution of Evangel Presbytery, actions out of accord with the deliverances of the Presbytery, and matters of impropriety and important delinquencies. Exceptions of Substance should be limited to serious irregularities, gross errors, corrupt practices and heretical opinions.

    Notations and exceptions of form shall normally be sent to the Clerk of Session by the Committee without being read before Presbytery or recorded in its minutes. Exceptions of substance shall be reported to Presbytery as recommendations to be voted upon. The Sessional Records shall be approved without exception; or with exception of form and/or substance.

    Sessions shall advise the Presbytery by the following Stated Meeting through the Sessional Records Committee that they have disposed of the exception of substance in one of the following manners: the Session agrees with the exception of substance, corrects its record or action if possible, and promises to try to be more careful in the future; or, the Session respectfully disagrees with the exception of substance, states its grounds and refers the exception back to the Presbytery for action. The Sessional Records Committee will bring a recommendation to Presbytery regarding whether or not the disposition of the matter should be considered satisfactory.

    The Sessional Records Committee shall report to Presbytery regarding any Sessional Records that have not been submitted for review in the past year.

    The Sessional Records Committee shall provide help for any Clerk of Session seeking guidance in preparing Sessional Records for the yearly Presbytery review.

\hypertarget{section-10-electronic-meetings}{%
\section*{Section 10: Electronic Meetings}\label{section-10-electronic-meetings}}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Section 10: Electronic Meetings}

Sometimes matters arise needing action prior to the next stated meeting of presbytery. When a special called meeting of presbytery or one of its committees, subcommittees, or commissions is impractical, special called meetings are allowed via any means of communication which allows all participants simultaneously to hear and communicate with each other (for example, tele-conference or video-conference). If a meeting is conducted by such means, the presiding officer shall inform all participants at the commencement of the meeting that a meeting is taking place at which official business may be transacted. Any participant in a meeting by such means shall be deemed present in person at such meeting. The moderator of the meeting may establish reasonable rules to conduct the meeting. Committees and subcommittees may hold their regular stated meetings in this manner, also.

Written consent by the members of the Presbytery, a committee, or a subcommittee can be undertaken via email, or other electronic record communication, if the written consent setting forth the action to be taken is circulated to all members via email, or other electronic record communication, and at least eighty percent (80\%) of the members indicate their approval by return email or other approved electronic record communication. The Presbytery shall confirm with each member the electronic address or addresses, such as an email address or text message number, for that member to be used for purposes of sending and receiving email, text or other electronic record communications, and for the purpose of notices to and from the Presbytery, and shall maintain such information as part of the Presbytery's current records, which may be maintained electronically. The Presbytery shall provide its address, and the electronic addresses of the other members, to be used for purposes of taking such action. The Presbytery may provide for any particular requirements, method or means for taking action electronically and for notices to and from the Presbytery and its members, in which case the action to be taken shall be taken in accordance with such requirements, method, or means.

  Formatting Guidelines

  All minutes should be typed. They should be simple in word and in formatting. Once minutes have been officially adopted by the Session, they should be archived digitally using the PDF file format. When submitting minutes for review by the Sessional Records Committee, all minutes from all meetings (session, congregational, etc.) should be included in one PDF document in chronological order with pages numbered consecutively, leaving no blank pages between meetings and no records left out. As with all important digital documents, great care should be taken to ensure that Session minute archives have both local and remote backups. Sessions may keep a physical hard copy of their minutes in addition to their digital copy. If they choose to do so, however, they must ensure that the physical archives do not conflict with the digital ones. The annual budget and annual statistical report should be submitted to the Sessional Records as separate PDF files.
\item
  Session Minutes must include the following:
