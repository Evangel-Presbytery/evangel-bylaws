## Section 1: Name {-}

The incorporated name of this body shall be "Evangel Presbytery, Inc."

## Section 2: Object {-}

The object of this body is to fulfill the requirements for the Presbytery as set forth in the *Book of Church Order of Evangel Presbytery* ([15.8](https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/form-of-government.html#the-presbytery); hereafter, “ *Book of Church Order” or “BCO”* ). The doctrinal and governmental standards of this Presbytery shall be those stated in the *Book of Church Order* ([Preface, C](https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/preface.html)). These Bylaws are not to conflict with the *Book of Church Order* , and in any case of conflict, the standards of the *Book of Church Order* shall take precedence.

## Section 3: Members {-}

Members of this Presbytery shall be in two classes: Ordained Ministers of the Word (Pastors) and the particular churches. Standards for examination for membership of both Ministers and churches shall be as set forth in the *Book of Church Order*. Representation of elders from particular churches shall be in accordance with the provisions of the *Book of Church Order*.

## Section 4: Officers {-}

All officers shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast at the Stated Meeting scheduled for that purpose. The various offices of the Presbytery, and their functions, are as follows:

A.  Moderator
    1. Eligibility: The Moderator shall be a Pastor who is a member in good standing of the Presbytery, or an Elder in good standing of a member church of the Presbytery. The Elder does not have to be currently active on the Session of his church if that church follows a rotation system for its Session. A moderator may not succeed himself, nor serve a second term in office within one year of previously having served.
    2. Tenure: The Moderator of the Presbytery shall be chosen at each stated meeting or for a period of time up to one (1) year ([*BCO* 12.3](https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/form-of-government.html#church-courtsin-general)). He will continue to serve in office until a successor is elected at a Stated Meeting. He will preside over called or other special meetings, and otherwise function as Moderator during his tenure. As a general rule, the position of Moderator should alternate between Pastors and Elders.
    3. Moderator-in-Nomination: At each Stated Meeting of Presbytery or at the Stated Meeting preceding the final meeting of the current Moderator’s tenure, a Moderator-in-Nomination will be elected, with the understanding that his name will automatically be placed in nomination for the office of moderator at the next Stated Meeting. This policy is established to enable men to prepare themselves to function in this office to the best of their ability, and to be aware of current issues before the court. However, election as Moderator-in-Nomination does not require the Presbytery to elect this nominee at its next Stated Meeting, at which time a normal process of nominations and elections will be followed.
    4. Duties:
        a. The Moderator of Presbytery will function as chairman of all meetings of Presbytery, following approved parliamentary procedure.
        b. If no worship service has been held prior to the meeting of Presbytery, the retiring Moderator shall ordinarily bring a message from God's Word in an appropriate time of devotion.
        c. Between meetings, the Moderator has the responsibility to speak for the Presbytery in matters in which the Presbytery itself has made its commitments clear, and he should be consulted in all matters affecting the Presbytery as a whole.
        d. He may appoint a Parliamentarian to serve for each Stated Meeting.
        e. In any emergency the Moderator may, by adequate and appropriate means, including circular letter, telephone notification, or email, change the time or place (or both) of meetings to which the court stands adjourned, giving reasonable notice of such change.
        f. The Moderator shall nominate the members of Temporary Committees and Ad Interim Committees. Nominees will be approved by the Presbytery.

He may also advise the members of these committees to elect chairmen from among themselves.
        g. The Moderator, by the authority vested in him, is an ex-officio member of the Administrative Committee.
B.  Vice Moderator

    The Vice Moderator shall be the immediate past Moderator and shall serve at the request of the Moderator, or when the Moderator is unable to serve. In the event the Vice Moderator is not able to serve, the Stated Clerk shall preside, and, as its first order of business, Presbytery shall nominate and elect a Moderator Pro Tem to moderate during the Moderator’s and Vice Moderator’s absence. The Vice Moderator, by the authority vested in him, is an ex-officio member of the Administrative Committee.

## Section 10: Electronic Meetings {-}

Sometimes matters arise needing action prior to the next stated meeting of presbytery. When a special called meeting of presbytery or one of its committees, subcommittees, or commissions is impractical, special called meetings are allowed via any means of communication which allows all participants simultaneously to hear and communicate with each other (for example, tele-conference or video-conference). If a meeting is conducted by such means, the presiding officer shall inform all participants at the commencement of the meeting that a meeting is taking place at which official business may be transacted. Any participant in a meeting by such means shall be deemed present in person at such meeting. The moderator of the meeting may establish reasonable rules to conduct the meeting. Committees and subcommittees may hold their regular stated meetings in this manner, also.

Written consent by the members of the Presbytery, a committee, or a subcommittee can be undertaken via email, or other electronic record communication, if the written consent setting forth the action to be taken is circulated to all members via email, or other electronic record communication, and at least eighty percent (80%) of the members indicate their approval by return email or other approved electronic record communication.

## Appendix 1: Guidelines for Keeping Sessional Records {-}

A.  Formatting Guidelines

    All minutes should be typed. They should be simple in word and in formatting. When submitting minutes for review by the Sessional Records Committee, all minutes from all meetings (session, congregational, etc.) should be included in one PDF document in chronological order with pages numbered consecutively, leaving no blank pages between meetings and no records left out. As with all important digital documents, great care should be taken to ensure that Session minute archives have both local and remote backups. Sessions may keep a physical hard copy of their minutes in addition to their digital copy. If they choose to do so, however, they must ensure that the physical archives do not conflict with the digital ones. The annual budget and annual statistical report should be submitted to the Sessional Records as separate PDF files.
    
B.  Session Minutes must include the following:

    1. A statement of the date, time, place, and purpose of the meeting (stated (i.e., regular scheduled), called, special called, etc.)
    2. The portion of a call that indicates the purpose of any called meeting.
    3. That the meeting was opened and closed with prayer.
    4. The names of all in attendance or absent from the meeting.
    5. That a quorum was present for the meeting.
    6. Communications received, and any action taken because of the communications.
    7. Adoption of the minutes from previous meeting(s).
    8. A statement that indicates the receiving of the Treasurer’s report (a.k.a financial report) as information.
    9. The actions of the Session including all the motions adopted and business transacted.


C.  When applicable, the minutes shall include the following:
    1. A record of all baptisms and dates of the celebration of the Lord’s Supper.
    2. Election of commissioners to presbytery.
    3. A record of the call and purpose for each congregational or corporation meeting.
    4. A motion calling for the nomination and election of church officers.
    5. A record of the officers nominated, trained and examined by the Session.
    6. A statement that indicates the review and approval of the Deacons' minutes.
    7. A statement in the December or the following January minutes that records annual housing allowance(s) approved by the Session for pastoral staff.
    8. "A fair record of baptisms, of those admitted to the Lord’s table, of non-communing members, and of the births, marriages, deaths, and dismissions of church members and of any baptisms and marriage ceremonies presided over by the pastors of the church outside its bounds" ([*BCO* 14.8](https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/form-of-government.html#the-church-session)).
    9. A copy of the approved operating budget and the yearly statistical report should be attached to the minutes once per year.

D.  The following additional records should be kept and submitted once per year:

    1. An annual statistical report which contains “...a fair record of baptisms, of those admitted to the Lord’s table, of non-communing members, and of the births, marriages, deaths, and dismissions of church members and of any baptisms and marriage ceremonies presided over by the pastors of the church outside its bounds” ([BCO 14.8](https://bco.evangelpresbytery.com/form-of-government.html#the-church-session)).
