# Officers

All officers shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast at the Stated Meeting scheduled for that purpose. The various offices of the Presbytery, and their functions, are as follows:

A. Moderator

  1. Eligibility: The Moderator shall be a Pastor who is a member in good standing of the Presbytery, or an Elder in good standing of a member church of the Presbytery. The Elder does not have to be currently active on the Session of his church if that church follows a rotation system for its Session. A moderator may not succeed himself, nor serve a second term in office within one year of previously having served.
  2. Tenure: The Moderator of the Presbytery shall be chosen at each stated meeting or for a period of time up to one (1) year (BCO 12.3). He will continue to serve in office until a successor is elected at a Stated Meeting. He will preside over called or other special meetings, and otherwise function as Moderator during his tenure. As a general rule, the position of Moderator should alternate between Pastors and Elders.
  3. Moderator-in-Nomination: At each Stated Meeting of Presbytery or at the Stated Meeting preceding the final meeting of the current Moderator’s tenure, a Moderator-in-Nomination will be elected, with the understanding that his name will automatically be placed in nomination for the office of moderator at the next Stated Meeting. This policy is established to enable men to prepare themselves to function in this office to the best of their ability, and to be aware of current issues before the court. However, election as Moderator-in-Nomination does not require the Presbytery to elect this nominee at its next Stated Meeting, at which time a normal process of nominations and elections will be followed.
  4. Duties:

    a. The Moderator of Presbytery will function as chairman of all meetings of Presbytery, following approved parliamentary procedure.
    b. If no worship service has been held prior to the meeting of Presbytery, the retiring Moderator shall ordinarily bring a message from God's Word in an appropriate time of devotion.
    c. Between meetings, the Moderator has the responsibility to speak for the Presbytery in matters in which the Presbytery itself has made its commitments clear, and he should be consulted in all matters affecting the Presbytery as a whole.
    d. He may appoint a Parliamentarian to serve for each Stated Meeting.
    e. In any emergency the Moderator may, by adequate and appropriate means, including circular letter, telephone notification, or email, change the time or place (or both) of meetings to which the court stands adjourned, giving reasonable notice of such change.
    f. The Moderator shall nominate the members of Temporary Committees and Ad Interim Committees. Nominees will be approved by the Presbytery. The Moderator shall appoint the chairmen of Temporary Committees and Ad Interim Committees and inform the Presbytery of his appointment. He may also advise the members of these committees to elect chairmen from among themselves.
    g. The Moderator, by the authority vested in him, is an ex-officio member of the Administrative Committee.
