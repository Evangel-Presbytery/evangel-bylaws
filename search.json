    "text": "2. Mission, Vision, and Core Commitments\n\nMission\nBuilding faithful churches, standing for God’s Word, forging shepherds for Christ’s Kingdom.\n\n\nVision\nTo see a faithful and courageous Reformed witness thrive across generations – raising up godly men to lead in the home, church, and society, cultivating joyful submission to Christ’s authority in every sphere of life. We seek to plant and strengthen churches that boldly proclaim the whole counsel of God, guard the sacraments, shepherd souls with love and discipline, and stand immovable against the idols of our age.\n\n\nCore Commitments\nProclaiming and Defending Truth – We boldly proclaim the whole truth of God’s Word, seeking repentance and faith, while fighting against the besetting sins of the current age in our own lives, in the church, and in the world.\nUpholding the Reformed Faith – We uphold the divine authority of Scripture, the centrality of the Gospel, justification by grace alone through faith alone, the necessity of good works and the pursuit of holiness in the life of believers, and the exaltation of Jesus Christ in all things, as faithfully summarized in the Westminster Confession of Faith.\nEmbracing Authority – We recognize that God has given authority to the family, church, and civil spheres, calling men as husbands, fathers, pastors and elders, and civil authorities to lead under His rule. We reject abuse of authority — whether tyranny or neglect — and any rebellion that seeks to subvert God’s ordained order. Shepherding the Church – We prioritize pastoral care, faithfully shepherding souls with biblical truth, engaging in loving discipline, and encouraging accountability within the presbytery and our congregations.\nTeaching Biblical Anthropology – We affirm that man, made in the image of God, possesses value and dignity. We therefore defend the right to life and oppose all forms of abortion and euthanasia; and oppose all attacks on God’s creational design of man as male or female.\nUniting on Baptism and Guarding the Lord’s Supper – We believe that baptism is a sign of covenantal inclusion and union with Christ, but not regenerative in itself. We grant freedom of conscience regarding the time and mode of baptism, and our church communions include both credobaptists and paedobaptists. Following Scripture’s command that the Lord’s Supper be given only to those able to examine themselves in faith, we reject the practice of paedocommunion.\nPlanting Churches and Growing God’s Kingdom – We are committed to advancing Christ’s Kingdom by planting and supporting biblically faithful churches, proclaiming the Gospel in every place, and calling all people to obey everything Christ has commanded. We labor to see Christ honored in all of life as we cultivate churches marked by love, hospitality, and joyful submission to God’s Word.",

    "text": "11. Electronic Meetings\nSometimes matters arise needing action prior to the next stated meeting of presbytery. When a special called meeting of presbytery or one of its committees, subcommittees, or commissions is impractical, special called meetings are allowed via any means of communication which allows all participants simultaneously to hear and communicate with each other (for example, tele-conference or video-conference). If a meeting is conducted by such means, the presiding officer shall inform all participants at the commencement of the meeting that a meeting is taking place at which official business may be transacted. Any participant in a meeting by such means shall be deemed present in person at such meeting. The moderator of the meeting may establish reasonable rules to conduct the meeting. Committees and subcommittees may hold their regular stated meetings in this manner, also.\nWritten consent by the members of the Presbytery, a committee, or a subcommittee can be undertaken via email, or other electronic record communication, if the written consent setting forth the action to be taken is circulated to all members via email, or other electronic record communication, and at least eighty percent (80%) of the members indicate their approval by return email or other approved electronic record communication. The Presbytery shall confirm with each member the electronic address or addresses, such as an email address or text message number, for that member to be used for purposes of sending and receiving email, text or other electronic record communications, and for the purpose of notices to and from the Presbytery, and shall maintain such information as part of the Presbytery’s current records, which may be maintained electronically. The Presbytery shall provide its address, and the electronic addresses of the other members, to be used for purposes of taking such action. The Presbytery may provide for any particular requirements, method or means for taking action electronically and for notices to and from the Presbytery and its members, in which case the action to be taken shall be taken in accordance with such requirements, method, or means.",

    "text": "Appendix 1: Guidelines for Keeping Sessional Records\n\nFormatting Guidelines\nAll minutes should be typed. They should be simple in word and in formatting. When submitting minutes for review by the Sessional Records Committee, all minutes from all meetings (session, congregational, etc.) should be included in one PDF document in chronological order with pages numbered consecutively, leaving no blank pages between meetings and no records left out. As with all important digital documents, great care should be taken to ensure that Session minute archives have both local and remote backups. Sessions may keep a physical hard copy of their minutes in addition to their digital copy. If they choose to do so, however, they must ensure that the physical archives do not conflict with the digital ones. The annual budget and annual statistical report should be submitted to the Sessional Records as separate PDF files.\nSession Minutes must include the following:\n\nA statement of the date, time, place, and purpose of the meeting (stated (i.e., regular scheduled), called, special called, etc.)\nThe portion of a call that indicates the purpose of any called meeting.\nThat the meeting was opened and closed with prayer.\nThe names of all in attendance or absent from the meeting.\nThat a quorum was present for the meeting.\nCommunications received, and any action taken because of the communications.\nAdoption of the minutes from previous meeting(s).\nA statement that indicates the receiving of the Treasurer’s report (a.k.a financial report) as information.\nThe actions of the Session including all the motions adopted and business transacted.\n\nWhen applicable, the minutes shall include the following:\n\nA record of all baptisms and dates of the celebration of the Lord’s Supper.\nElection of commissioners to presbytery.\nA record of the call and purpose for each congregational or corporation meeting.\nA motion calling for the nomination and election of church officers.\nA record of the officers nominated, trained and examined by the Session.\nA statement that indicates the review and approval of the Deacons’ minutes.\nA statement in the December or the following January minutes that records annual housing allowance(s) approved by the Session for pastoral staff.\n“A fair record of baptisms, of those admitted to the Lord’s table, of non-communing members, and of the births, marriages, deaths, and dismissions of church members and of any baptisms and marriage ceremonies presided over by the pastors of the church outside its bounds” (BCO 14.8).\nA copy of the approved operating budget and the yearly statistical report should be attached to the minutes once per year.\n\nThe following additional records should be kept and submitted once per year:\n\nAn annual statistical report which contains “…a fair record of baptisms, of those admitted to the Lord’s table, of non-communing members, and of the births, marriages, deaths, and dismissions of church members and of any baptisms and marriage ceremonies presided over by the pastors of the church outside its bounds” (BCO 14.8).\nA copy of the approved operating budget.",
