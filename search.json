    "text": "Evangel Presbytery Bylaws\n\n1. Name\nThe incorporated name of this body shall be “Evangel Presbytery, Inc.”\n\n\n2. Object\nThe object of this body is to fulfill the requirements for the Presbytery as set forth in the Book of Church Order of Evangel Presbytery (15.8; hereafter, “Book of Church Order” or “BCO” ). The doctrinal and governmental standards of this Presbytery shall be those stated in the Book of Church Order (Preface, C). These Bylaws are not to conflict with the Book of Church Order , and in any case of conflict, the standards of the Book of Church Order shall take precedence.\n\n\n3. Members\nMembers of this Presbytery shall be in two classes: Ordained Ministers of the Word (Pastors) and the particular churches. Standards for examination for membership of both Ministers and churches shall be as set forth in the Book of Church Order. Representation of elders from particular churches shall be in accordance with the provisions of the Book of Church Order.\n\n\n4. Officers\nAll officers shall be elected by a majority of the votes cast at the Stated Meeting scheduled for that purpose. The various offices of the Presbytery, and their functions, are as follows:\n\nModerator\n\nEligibility: The Moderator shall be a Pastor who is a member in good standing of the Presbytery, or an Elder in good standing of a member church of the Presbytery.

A moderator may not succeed himself, nor serve a second term in office within one year of previously having served.\nTenure: The Moderator of the Presbytery shall be chosen at each stated meeting or for a period of time up to one (1) year (BCO 12.3). He will continue to serve in office until a successor is elected at a Stated Meeting. He will preside over called or other special meetings, and otherwise function as Moderator during his tenure. As a general rule, the position of Moderator should alternate between Pastors and Elders.\nModerator-in-Nomination: At each Stated Meeting of Presbytery or at the Stated Meeting preceding the final meeting of the current Moderator’s tenure, a Moderator-in-Nomination will be elected, with the understanding that his name will automatically be placed in nomination for the office of moderator at the next Stated Meeting. This policy is established to enable men to prepare themselves to function in this office to the best of their ability, and to be aware of current issues before the court. However, election as Moderator-in-Nomination does not require the Presbytery to elect this nominee at its next Stated Meeting, at which time a normal process of nominations and elections will be followed.\nDuties:\n\nThe Moderator of Presbytery will function as chairman of all meetings of Presbytery, following approved parliamentary procedure.\nIf no worship service has been held prior to the meeting of Presbytery, the retiring Moderator shall ordinarily bring a message from God’s Word in an appropriate time of devotion.\nBetween meetings, the Moderator has the responsibility to speak for the Presbytery in matters in which the Presbytery itself has made its commitments clear, and he should be consulted in all matters affecting the Presbytery as a whole.\nHe may appoint a Parliamentarian to serve for each Stated Meeting.\nIn any emergency the Moderator may, by adequate and appropriate means, including circular letter, telephone notification, or email, change the time or place (or both) of meetings to which the court stands adjourned, giving reasonable notice of such change.\nThe Moderator shall appoint the members of Temporary Committees and Ad Interim Committees.

In the event of the disestablishment of a committee, all such records shall be placed in the hands of the Stated Clerk.\nActivities\nAll committees shall hold duly constituted meetings at least once a year and report at least annually to Presbytery.

Electronic Meetings\nSometimes matters arise needing action prior to the next stated meeting of presbytery. When a special called meeting of presbytery or one of its committees, subcommittees, or commissions is impractical, special called meetings are allowed via any means of communication which allows all participants simultaneously to hear and communicate with each other (for example, tele-conference or video-conference). If a meeting is conducted by such means, the presiding officer shall inform all participants at the commencement of the meeting that a meeting is taking place at which official business may be transacted. Any participant in a meeting by such means shall be deemed present in person at such meeting. The moderator of the meeting may establish reasonable rules to conduct the meeting. Committees and subcommittees may hold their regular stated meetings in this manner, also.\nWritten consent by the members of the Presbytery, a committee, or a subcommittee can be undertaken via email, or other electronic record communication, if the written consent setting forth the action to be taken is circulated to all members via email, or other electronic record communication, and at least eighty percent (80%) of the members indicate their approval by return email or other approved electronic record communication. The Presbytery shall confirm with each member the electronic address or addresses, such as an email address or text message number, for that member to be used for purposes of sending and receiving email, text or other electronic record communications, and for the purpose of notices to and from the Presbytery, and shall maintain such information as part of the Presbytery’s current records, which may be maintained electronically. The Presbytery shall provide its address, and the electronic addresses of the other members, to be used for purposes of taking such action. The Presbytery may provide for any particular requirements, method or means for taking action electronically and for notices to and from the Presbytery and its members, in which case the action to be taken shall be taken in accordance with such requirements, method, or means.\n\n\n11. Parliamentary Authority\nAll parliamentary procedures must be in accordance with the Book of Church Order and the most recent edition of Robert’s Rules of Order. The Moderator may appoint a member of Presbytery to assist him in these matters, who will serve as Parliamentarian only for the term of the actual meeting.\n\n\n12. Suspension and Amendment of Bylaws\nThese Bylaws may be temporarily suspended, amended, or revised at any Stated Meeting of Presbytery by a two-thirds (2/3) majority of the votes cast, unless such suspension, amendment, or revision would violate any part of the Book of Church Order. Any permanent amendment, revision, or repeal of the Bylaws must be proposed in writing at a Stated Meeting, approved by a two-thirds (2/3) majority of the votes cast of that Stated Meeting, and ratified by a two-thirds (2/3) majority of the votes cast at the following Stated Meeting of Presbytery.\n\n\nAppendix 1: Guidelines for Keeping Sessional Records\n\nFormatting Guidelines\nAll minutes should be typed.

When submitting minutes for review by the Sessional Records Committee, all minutes from all meetings (session, congregational, etc.) should be included in one PDF document in chronological order with pages numbered consecutively, leaving no blank pages between meetings and no records left out. As with all important digital documents, great care should be taken to ensure that Session minute archives have both local and remote backups.
