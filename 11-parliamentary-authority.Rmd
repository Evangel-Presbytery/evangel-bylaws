# Parliamentary Authority

All parliamentary procedures must be in accordance with the *Book of Church Order* and the most recent edition of *Robertâ€™s Rules of Order*. The Moderator may appoint a member of Presbytery to assist him in these matters, who will serve as Parliamentarian only for the term of the actual meeting.
